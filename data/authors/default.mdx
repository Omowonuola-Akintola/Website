Hi, you can call me Ola (uh-la or HOLA)!!

I am passionate about technology, mapping, and innovation and their power to transform lives across the globe.

I work in the geospatial industry and focused on using open geospatial data and tech to make communities visible, first in the energy sector and now in the humanitarian space.
My career resolves around working to improve data availability in Africa to support humanitarian crises, build more inclusive communities, and document the impact of climate change.

Locally-driven research and innovation is crucial for developing solutions that effectively address the specific challenges faced by local communities, but the current technical 
data gaps in Africa is too huge. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Earth Observation and Data Science to allow me contribute to efforts in humanitarian research and response 
locally and globally.

My community work involves bridging the digital divide to ensure that local talents can support local problems through organizing conferences, podcasting, and designing education 
platforms. My most recent contribution here is designing The Women Learn Program(WLP) to equip women  from developing countries with relevant technology skills that allows them to 
contribute to projects within their community. I hope to also contribute to policy research to ensure that there are proper policy that supports the adoption of geospatial technology
in Africa.

In my free time, I like to disturb the people I love and take pictures of the world.
