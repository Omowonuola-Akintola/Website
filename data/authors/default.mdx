Hi, you can call me Ola (uh-la or HOLA)!!

I am passionate about technology, mapping, and innovation and their power to transform lives across the globe.

I work in the geospatial industry and focused on using open geospatial data and tech to make communities visible, first in the energy sector and now in the humanitarian space.
My professional work revolves around improving data availability in Africa to support electrification planning, humanitarian crises, climate issues, and build more inclusive communities.

Locally-driven research and innovation is crucial for developing solutions that effectively address the specific challenges faced by local communities, but the current technical 
data gaps in Africa is too huge. I am currently pursuing my Masters in [Earth Observation and Data Science](https://master-cde.eu) to allow me contribute to efforts in EO and humanitarian research and response 
locally and globally. 

My community work involves bridging the digital divide to ensure that local talents have resources they need to contribute meaningfully through [organizing conferences](https://www.youtube.com/@gisfest), 
[podcasting](https://open.spotify.com/show/0LGHyoUC6EIj1T8djbDBne), and designing education programs. My most recent contribution here is designing [The Women Learn Program WLP](https://omowonuola-akintola.github.io/website/projects) 
to equip women from developing countries with relevant technology skills that allows them to contribute to projects within their community. I hope to also contribute to policy research to ensure that there are proper policy that supports 
the adoption of geospatial technology in Africa.

In my free time, I like to disturb the people I love and take pictures of the world.
