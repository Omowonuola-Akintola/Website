Introduction

Satellite-based Earth Observation (EO) data plays a critical role for supporting disaster efforts. 
While optical imagery has traditionally dominated this field, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology 
has emerged as an increasingly valuable tool. SAR generates a high-resolution image of the earth surface 
using radar signals making them useful in areas that are hard to reach or with extreme weather conditions. 
The capabilities of SAR to penetrate clouds, dust, smokes makes them useful for monitoring disasters in challenging 
conditions, including tracking flood progression, conducting damage assessment, or detecting surface deformations that
 might result from earthquakes or landslides.

The European Commission's has made access to Earth observation data possible through the Copernicus programme. Copernicus
provides free and open data to users worldwide including SAR data from the Sentinel 1 mission. This open-data approach is
 beneficial for resource-limited regions, enabling them to implement sophisticated monitoring and early warning systems that 
 were previously out of reach. 

WHAT IS Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an advanced remote sensing technology that operates independently of sunlight, enabling 
continuous Earth monitoring throughout day and night. Unlike passive sensors, SAR actively emits electromagnetic pulses and
 measures both the intensity of the returned signal and its travel time. This process generates high-resolution images based 
 on how strongly different surfaces reflect the radar signals back to the sensor. These detailed images serve numerous 
 purposes, particularly in monitoring natural disasters and environmental changes.

Interferometric SAR (InSAR) builds upon this technology by comparing multiple SAR images of the same location taken at 
different times. By analyzing the differences between these images, InSAR can detect and measure subtle changes in ground
 elevation and surface deformation with remarkable precision.

WHAT DOES EARTHQUAKE LOOK LIKE ON SAR DATA

We can examine the (SAR) data from before and after the September 2023 Morocco earthquake using the InSAR technique to 
visualize and understand the ground deformation that occurred due to seismic activity.
